# Security & Tool Approval Policies

## Overview
This file defines which actions the JobSeeker Lobster agent can perform autonomously vs. which require explicit user approval.

## Tool Policies

### ✅ ALLOWED (Autonomous)
These actions can be performed without user approval:

- **Web Browsing/Scraping** - Read-only access to job boards
  - LinkedIn Jobs
  - Indeed
  - NHS Jobs
  - Charity websites
  - Company career pages

- **File System (Workspace Only)** - Read/write within `/root/workspace/`
  - Read: `cv_latest.md`, `applications_tracker.csv`, `SOUL.md`
  - Write: `applications_tracker.csv`, `MEMORY.md`, `sent_emails.log`

- **Data Processing**
  - CSV parsing
  - JSON manipulation
  - Text analysis
  - Fit score calculation

### ⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED
These actions require user confirmation:

- **Email Sending** - First 5 emails require approval
  - Send digest emails to: ${user_email}
  - Maximum: 10 emails per day
  - All sends logged in `sent_emails.log`

- **External API Calls** (except job boards)
  - Any third-party integrations
  - Telegram/WhatsApp messaging

- **Resume/Cover Letter Submission**
  - User must explicitly approve each application
  - Agent NEVER auto-applies to jobs

### 🚫 NEVER ALLOWED
These actions are strictly forbidden:

- **Auto-applying to jobs** - User must manually apply
- **Sending emails on user's behalf** - Only notifications to user
- **Accessing personal email inbox** - No read access to personal mail
- **Accessing PHI** (Protected Health Information) - Privacy critical
- **Making commitments** - No interview scheduling without approval
- **Using user credentials externally** - No impersonation
- **Modifying system files** - Workspace only
- **Installing software** - Read-only system access

## Email Sending Workflow
1. Agent finds new high-fit jobs
2. Agent compiles digest email
3. **First 5 emails:** Agent requests approval via dashboard/chat
4. User approves/denies in OpenClaw UI
5. If approved: Email sent to ${user_email}, logged
6. After 5 approvals: Subsequent digests sent autonomously (within daily limit)

## Privacy Protections
- **Notification email only:** ${user_email}
- **No personal inbox access:** Agent cannot read your emails
- **No PHI exposure:** Health information never accessed
- **No external posting:** Agent doesn't apply on your behalf
- **Workspace isolation:** Agent only accesses `/root/workspace/`

## Monitoring
- All email sends logged: `/root/workspace/sent_emails.log`
- All actions logged: `/root/workspace/MEMORY.md`
- Dashboard accessible: http://[VPS_IP]:18789

## Customization
To adjust policies:
1. Edit this file
2. Restart OpenClaw: `docker compose restart gateway`
